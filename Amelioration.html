		<h2> Amelioration </h2>

		<p> On my way to work this morning, I bit into a crisp apple. There's something romantic about eating an apple on an autumn morning that gets lost in translation as the seasons cycle on. It's currently March. This was not a romantic apple.</p>
		<p> Chewing closer and closer towards the center, flesh and skin tumbling together in my mouth, I recall summer road trips to the Berkshires. James Taylor on the radio, achingly colorful skies at dusk, the soft breeze of the Taconic infiltrating the family car, my mother in the passenger seat, sinking her teeth into a piece of fruit. Nectarines in June, peaches in July, plums in August, juice dribbling down her chin, wide eyes, content. Apples -- the romantic kind -- were for September, when that end-of-summer, orchard-and-bonfire scent perfumed the air. She used to hurl the stone fruit pits and acidic apple cores out of her rolled down window. They would spiral backwards into space at sixty miles per hour as our car careened across state lines with never-ending inertia.</p>
		<p> Since my birth, my mother has imbued in me a force that tugs at my gut right before the need to change overcomes me. Throughout my life, I have felt the acute and overwhelming urge to change: my skin, my life, or the room I'm in. It is probable that I am not change's sole victim. Acknowledge the physiology of this chain reaction with me: start in the brain; recognize a vital neurological jerk as it awakens the stomach and reverberates down the spinal cord, sparking every synaptic gap into action. It is an all-or-nothing firing of every cell, a phenomenon that thrusts me into driver's seats, propels me onto train platforms, and inevitably, across state lines. Without ballast, I am as boundless as blood coursing through veins. Change, like my evolution and my undoing, is the one constant relationship in my life, lodged deep under my skin within the genetic code given to me by the woman in the passenger seat. I'm a vagabond in these moments unless something anchors me -- a sensation, an obligation, a person. But anchors are few and far between in life and for the most part, organic matter flies unfettered through time and space, perishing as it goes.</p>
		<p>It always irked me, watching my mother flick a wrist and expel the heart of something. I grieved for those apple cores, abandoned on roadsides with car crash wreaths and makeshift wooden crosses. Roadside monuments never cease to unsettle me: they blend into my understanding of the now-familiar landscape, whisper a distant, bloody history through wildflower stems. They are ever-present reminders that an object at rest will stay at rest, fastened into soil, tethered to the earth by disintegration. That spot in my gut would pound furiously as I watched cores sail, nearly missing remembrances: the bereaved, my mother, were altering this pastoral that I had memorized. Effectively littering. Yet when I fussed over the minutiae my mother had speckled across the landscape, she breathed a confident laugh, insisting that her flippant disposal was environmentally sound and that her actions changed nothing. In a way, she was returning something borrowed.</p>
		<p>Outside of my office building, I stare at the core I've been gnawing towards. The word biodegradable writes itself on the oxidized decay of my apple. Expiration and creation became bedfellows in my mind's eye. Expiration is too finite a word. Amelioration -- an uninterrupted stream of enrichment -- that fits the resounding, knowing thud in my gut. I consider body parts and apple seeds mingling as they decompose into fecund earth, taking this almost spring into summer into that time of year where romantic apples return.</p>
		<p>Before entering the building, I hurl my apple core into the woods. This was a private send-off and a prayerful rebirth. Once I felt compelled to memorialize something that was built to deteriorate; now I long to encourage its natural course. Human bodies and pieces of fruit serve a common purpose. Betterment comes naturally. We all must return whatever it is we have borrowed.</p>
