		<h2> Commuting: An Ode to Joy </h2>

		<p> Hello ladies (and gents) of Concrete Empire! It's me, Molly... I know it's been a while, but I'm back for the summer, I promise. I've really missed you all! It feels marvelous to return to something stable after the two whirlwind months I've just had. As I'm sure is the case for a lot of you, people in my life (myself included) have been going through some serious flux lately. So many of the big things happen in June, don't they? Between marriage celebrations, graduations, and major home relocations, I've been celebrating with my friends and family, and having my first major 9-5 office job in New York City, writing has unfortunately been bumped onto my mental backburner. It's not that there hasn't been anything to write about -- in fact, while I was carted away from my office building in an ambulance (because I lost consciousness my second day on the job*), I mentally scolded myself to remember EVERYTHING and write it all out at a later date. However, there hasn't been the time, because my life is now dominated by this crazy sport people call commuting. I'm sure many of you participate along with me.</p>

		<p>My prior relationship with commuting existed conceptually. Backstory: when I was maybe nine years old, I was in a play at summer camp. In that play, there was a scene in which my cast of fellow nine-year-olds attempted to depict what we believed was the average adult's morning commute into New York City. Flapping newspapers bigger than our bodies and jiggling in place to mimic the rattle of the subway, we sighed together in heavy syncopation, while our "pit" (another three nine-year-olds on wooden recorders) tooted out Beethoven's "Ode to Joy." The adults present at each performance found this uproariously funny. I'm sure you're chuckling too. An ode to all the joys of commuting. I always thought I understood this joke. I knew adults who commuted to New York City. I had been on the train before. To my youthful mind, all commuting involved was a lot of coffee and putting on my grumpiest face. But then again, so did adulthood in general. Little did I know...</p>


		<p>Ten years and several Metrocard price hikes later, I now commute to Water Street five days a week. And let me tell you, now I get the joke. Every month leading up to my first day of work, I relished the idea of being a commuter. Each day would be a grand adventure. I couldn't wait to have a daily routine, the kind that would become lovable and familiar, like the creases of my palms. Optimistically, I envisioned the easy-health Buzzfeed articles I could put to use and the dozens of office-fabulous summer outfits I could wear around town. My foray into the corporate America seemed enchanting in theory, as if playing proletariat for the summer would be a breezy game. Which sounds extraordinarily condescending once written out, but I was hired as an intern. It's common knowledge that interns (well, non-Concrete Empire interns that is ;) !) take care of the work around the office that everyone can do, but no one wants to do. I knew I wouldn't be careening around Manhattan running errands for Miranda Priestly...so how demanding could this whole exercise be?</p>


		<p> As it turns out, very. My daydreams of work had rarely included the necessity of sensible shoes (blisters are non-negotiable when you have to hustle from Wall Street to Water Street). Or those rainy mornings where it's someone needs medical attention on the 4, thus forcing me to take a local and punch into work late. Other things that I never thought about:</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 250px"> a. How trains these days look like caterpillars (it takes closer examination to understand where the head and tail are. Gone are the days of the robust engine, complete with a caboose, which bums me out (no pun intended)). </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 250px"> b. The distinct discomfort of grabbing a warm subway pole </p>
		<p style="margin-left: 250px"> c. The amount of Purelle required after making direct contact with that aforementioned warm pole. </p>

	<p> My commute consists of skittering between three different vehicles twice a day each (see: a car ride to the train station, a train into the city, a journey on either the 4 or 5 subway line, and a 5 block sprint to my office). To accomplish this feat daily, I'm awake by 6:15 AM and asleep by 10:15PM (on Melatonin for additional sleep support). I drink one small cup of coffee per day (if any -- can't mess up the aforementioned sleep schedule), and avoid the 3 p's (people, plans, and paying for things I don't absolutely need) as often as possible. And want to know a dirty little secret? It sucks. I never imagined I could be this tired on a daily basis without training for a decathlon, yet here I am, ending most of my weekdays splayed out like a polar bear rug on the floor of my bedroom. </p>
	<p> Some days it feels like commuting is stealing the things I love: time with friends, money (I'm paid for my job but Metro North ultimately profits from my labor), even the ability to stay awake. But through the sweat, the rain, and the blisters, I find myself fascinated by the tiniest wonders each day. If I didn't commute, I wouldn't catch all of the little ways that the universe winks at me. As I'm sure many of my fellow commuters all over can attest to, commuting forces me to pay attention to what I've come to consider the real small joys. I don't know if the happenings I witness qualify as miracles, but the only explanation that this agnostic can come up with is that New York City and its inhabitants have been charmed through some crazy act of divine intervention. For instance, as I write now from my early-morning Metro North train, I'm watching a woman flawlessly apply mascara. We're hurtling south at breakneck speeds, and she's balanced there primly, perfecting her lashes. God or no god...bless. Don't even get me started on the student commuters. Some higher power has excused them from the laws of physics, and despite the subway's lurch, they remain oblivious, heads buried in their textbooks. Then there are the awe-inspiring throngs of stiletto-ed women that I catch loping around downtown. Their feet must be supernaturally gifted, impervious to cobblestones, grime, and pain (which is the sort of black magic I could really get behind, tbh). And above all, I find small joy in the gulp of air I'm sure is my last (but never is) that I take before the subway doors narrowly seal me in. </p>
	<p> Yes, there are small joys in every segment of my commute. Nothing warms or lifts my heart more than watching New Yorkers -- the most invincible species known to man -- stand up for each other. Seeing the gangly boy in basketball shorts offer his subway seat to a woman with a cane; smiling quietly to myself as I watch the college freshman who busks with his flute near my building earn another dollar for his tuition fund... each is a victory against New York's frigid reputation. I've come to appreciate that despite its lack of sleep, New York isn't always cranky. </p>
	<p> Right now I'm on my train home, and I swear that I'm seeing a man's sweaty red T-shirt create the imprint of a heart against the clear barrier of the car's door. As the train wobbles out of the underground, the heart beats to a rhythm of its own. Gross, but hopeful, like most summer days in New York. These are the moments that remind me to keep my eyes peeled, even in the face of chaos. Just like everything else in New York, the joy is there for those who seek it out. Until next time...</p>
