		<h2> What We Should Talk About When We Talk About Loving </h2>

		<p>Raymond Carver begged a question in 1981 that I'd love to aim at Hollywood: what do we talk about when we talk about love? Is it Humphrey Bogart bidding Ingrid Bergman farewell with a, "Here's looking at you, kid"? Billy Crystal realizing that when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible? For Hollywood, these dramatic revelations are exactly what we talk about. But in that kind of conversation, what becomes of the tacit and earnest expressions of love most viewers experience outside the theater? Jeff Nichols' Loving talks about love in its most intimate moments and discusses it the way the majority of viewers do: often without words at all. </p>
		<p>Set in 1958 in Caroline County, Virgina, Loving tells the story of Richard Loving (Joel Edgerton) and Mildred Loving (Ruth Negga), the plaintiffs in the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court case that ultimately invalidated state laws against interracial marriage. Audiences entering the theater ready for a dazzling two hours of martyrdom and Hollywood bravery be warned -- you will leave without a bold, quotable moment. However, you will certainly leave with an admiration for Nichols' ability to reveal the cinematic side of a reserved couple trying their best to simply live their lives together. Your breath will hitch in the quiet moments -- watching Richard patiently set brick by brick over and over again at his construction job, even as his family life becomes a web of media coverage and danger he is reluctant to accept. Moisture may seep into your own eyes as you behold Mildred, soft but stern and ready to change America, embracing Richard when he is brave enough to cry in front of her. The couple's separate admissions of fear and love are exchanged through the whispers of fingertips and knowing looks, especially in front of law enforcement and media, making viewers question how they ever could have believed that onscreen, loving needed to be depicted a splashy affair.</p>
		<p>The picture is not perfect -- while Negga's performance speaks softly and carries a big stick, the inclusion of a quotation from the real Mildred Loving in the film's conclusion undermines the power of what viewers have witnessed to that point (the film's parting line is Mildred insisting that "[Richard] protected me," when she protected herself by fighting until their case reached the Supreme Court). Similarly, the shock of seeing Nick Kroll in a dramatic role (as the questionably capable ACLU lawyer Bernard Cohen) never quite wore off, a weak attempt at comedic relief where none was necessarily needed. Even so, upon leaving the theater, one can't help but feel what Carver once wrote of. Sitting before a candid Life magazine photo of the real Richard and Mildred laying in each other's arms, you understand what Hollywood should be talking about when it talks about love because you can hear your heart beating. You can hear everyone's heart. You can hear the human noise you all sit there making, not one of you moving, not even when the room goes dark.</p>
